### CortexAI™ Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2025-08-31

This draft outlines HIPAA/GDPR-ready practices for CortexAI™. We empower, not diagnose. This policy will be reviewed by legal/compliance before production use.

- **Scope**: Unity client, FastAPI services, and analytics dashboard.
- **Data categories**: Account identifiers (email), usage logs, session metadata (mood tags, durations). We avoid storing raw therapy transcripts unless explicitly enabled and consented.
- **Legal bases (GDPR)**: Performance of contract, legitimate interests, consent where required.
- **HIPAA**: If acting as a Covered Entity/Business Associate, PHI safeguards apply. We minimize PHI; use de-identification, role-based access, and encryption.
- **Collection**: Minimal necessary data to deliver features; optional analytics via aggregated/anonymous data.
- **Use**: Authentication, session tracking, recommendations, product improvement (aggregate).
- **Sharing**: No sale. Third parties only for processing (hosting, storage) under DPAs/BAAs.
- **Storage & retention**: Encrypted at rest and in transit. Default retention 12 months for session metadata; user can request deletion earlier.
- **Security**: Encryption (TLS, AES-256 at rest), secrets management, audit logs, least privilege, periodic penetration testing.
- **Access & control**: Users can access, correct, export, or delete their data. We support data portability and right to be forgotten.
- **International transfers**: Safeguards such as SCCs where applicable.
- **Children**: Not directed to children under 13.
